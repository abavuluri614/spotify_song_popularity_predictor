# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

This project predicts whether a Spotify song will be popular based on its audio features
and artist mainstream level, and provides an interactive Streamlit app to test song ideas.

## Structure
NOTE: The trained Random Forest model (rf_spotify.pkl) is not included in the repository due to GitHub’s file size limit (25MB). It can be regenerated by running the 02_model_training.ipynb notebook.

## Installation
Install all dependencies using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run the Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open the project folder in VS Code or Jupyter Lab.
2. Make sure you have the required packages installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, joblib).
3. Start Jupyter:    
      jupyter notebook
   or in VS Code:
      Open Command Palette → “Python: Create Jupyter Notebook”
4. Run the notebooks in this order:

Notebook 1. 01_data_cleaning_eda.ipynb
 - Loads raw data
 - Cleans tracks and artist dataset
 - Merges + creates new features
 - Performs EDA
 - Saves cleaned_tracks.csv

Notebook 2. 02_model_training.ipynb
 - Loads cleaned dataset
 - Encodes categorical variables
 - Splits + scales the data
 - Trains logistic regression model
 - Trains random forest classifier
 - Saves model, scaler, and feature columns into /models/

## How to Run the Streamlit App

1. Navigate into the app/ folder, then run:
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

2. Your browser will open to an interactive UI where you can:
 - Choose genre
 - Set audio features
 - Set artist mainstream level
 - Get predicted popularity probability
